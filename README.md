# Automated-Testing
Automated Testing with Mocha, Chai, and Sinon

## Built With

* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) - the core framework: it provides common testing functions including describe and it and the main function that runs tests.
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - the library with many assertions. It allows to use a lot of different assertions, for now we need only assert.equal.
* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) - a library to spy over functions, emulate built-in functions and more, we’ll need it much later.

These libraries are suitable for both in-browser and server-side testing.
